* MailImp - simple mailing lists
** design principles
- one dedicated user per mailing list
- receive email via =.forward= or =.procmailrc=
 - =flock= to serialise
- send emails via =SMTP= local daemon
- configure via python script
- =systemd= for service/timers/logs
- don't care about portability outside the unix world
** TODO two stage operation
- =.forward= file stashes content (FLIH)
 - =~/spool/<content-hash>-<email-dest>= read-only
  - hard linked for any given <content-hash>
- second (SLIH) process
 - takes files from spool and does the obvious
 - runs off timer
 - launched as a process by FLIH
- maintenance sanity check validates hashes
